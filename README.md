# Scrummage
Scrummage is an OSINT tool that centralises your OSINT scans, leveraging powerful yet simple OSINT sites, drawing inspiration from the https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/Scumblr project as well as the the OSINT framework, a high-level overview of a range of sites that can be used to search for a variety of things, which can be found at https://osintframework.com/ or https://github.com/lockfale/OSINT-Framework.

While at first glance the web application may not look that original when compared to Scumblr, the plugins this tool uses is what makes this project unique, the web application is mainly just a simple, lightweight, and scalable way of bringing all the results together in one simple console, built on python's flask library for simplicity and scalability.

All feedback is welcome, as this is version 1 I'm sure there will be lots to improve on.
